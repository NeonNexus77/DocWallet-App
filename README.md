# 📁 DocWallet-App

**DocWallet** is a secure document management mobile application developed using **Flutter** and **Supabase**.  
The app allows users to store, organize, and securely share documents with others for a **limited period of time**, ensuring privacy and controlled access.

This project was built as a **student portfolio project** with a strong focus on **security-first design** and modern mobile application development practices.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

DocWallet is designed around the concept of **Time-Limited Sharing**, where users can grant access to documents for a specific duration.  
Once the sharing time expires, access is automatically revoked, preventing unauthorized usage.

The project follows a **Zero-Trust approach**, meaning access control is handled at the backend rather than relying solely on the mobile app interface.
